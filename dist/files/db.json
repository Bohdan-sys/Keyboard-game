      "text": "Назву «Карпати» вперше навів Геродот у V ст. до н. е. Батько історії згадував річку «Κάρπις» (Карпій), що впадає в Дунай. У 105 р. імператор Траян приєднав Південні Карпати (Дакію) до Риму. Римське панування в регіоні тривало до 271 р. Отже, Карпати були «відкриті» для цивілізованого світу. Тоді ж цю гірську систему, просторово дуже аморфну, вперше виокремив Птолемей (90—168)."

      "text": "Once upon a time, in the enchanting land of Veridiania, there lived a young girl named Lily. She was an adventurous soul, always yearning for excitement beyond the boundaries of her quaint village. One day, while exploring the deep woods on the outskirts of Veridiania, Lily stumbled upon an ancient, moss-covered stone with strange markings.\n\nIntrigued by the mysterious find, she carefully deciphered the markings and discovered they were a map leading to a hidden treasure rumored to grant one's deepest desires. Determined to embark on this thrilling quest, Lily decided to keep the discovery a secret and set out on her adventure alone, leaving a heartfelt note to her family explaining her mission.\n\nThe journey was filled with challenges, as the map led her through dense forests, treacherous mountains, and unknown territories. Along the way, she encountered magical creatures like talking foxes, wise owls, and mischievous fairies, who either helped or hindered her progress.\n\nAs she continued her quest, Lily faced her fears and learned valuable lessons about courage, resilience, and the importance of friendship. Along the way, she met a kindhearted young boy named Oliver, who had also stumbled upon a piece of the same ancient map. Together, they formed an unbreakable bond, supporting each other through the hardships and celebrating their triumphs.\n\nTheir journey was not without danger, as they encountered riddles guarding the treasure's location. Each riddle required them to think creatively and rely on their wits, which only deepened their friendship and trust in one another.\n\nFinally, after overcoming countless obstacles, they arrived at the heart of the Forbidden Caves. There, the ancient treasure awaited, a magnificent glowing orb said to possess the power to make dreams come true. But when Lily and Oliver touched the orb, they were both filled with a realization that their true desires were not for personal gain but rather to bring prosperity and happiness to their village and its people.\n\nTogether, they made a selfless wish, asking the orb to heal the village's drought-ridden lands and bring joy and harmony to all who lived there. As the orb glowed brighter than ever before, their wish was granted, and the land of Veridiania bloomed with life and abundance once again.\n\nWord of their heroic deeds spread throughout the land, and Lily and Oliver became celebrated as the young saviors of Veridiania. But the true reward for them was the knowledge that their friendship and selflessness had made a real difference in the lives of their loved ones.\n\nFrom that day on, Lily and Oliver continued to explore the wonders of Veridiania together, spreading kindness, joy, and bravery wherever they went. And so, their small village transformed into a beacon of hope and inspiration for all, reminding everyone that even the smallest among us can achieve greatness when driven by courage, friendship, and a heart filled with selfless love."
